# Developing a Wearable Parkinsonian Tremor Detector
Parkinson's disease affects over a million people in the USA and more than 10 million globally. A key challenge in treating Parkinson's is the accurate detection of symptoms to optimize therapy. Resting tremor, a symptom experienced by over 70% of patients, is characterized by a tremor in a supported body part (usually the hand or wrist) at rest, with minimal or no tremors during activity. The most common resting tremor has a frequency of 3 to 6 Hz.

The objective of this project is to develop a wearable device using the Adafruit Playground Classic board with its embedded accelerometer to detect Parkinsonian tremors. The device will capture real-time acceleration data, analyze it, and provide a visual indication of the presence and intensity of resting tremors using the board's resources (LEDs, speaker, neopixels, etc.). No additional hardware is required.
